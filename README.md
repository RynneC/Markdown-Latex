# Frequently used Markdown signs and methods
Frequently used signs and methods in markdown, collected and arranged by RynneC.

The files included in this project is the markdown notes that I take when learning this Ultra-light Text Makeup Language. I have put them in order, so as to remind me in case I might forget. Also, it might help introduce the language to you if you are a beginner. Hope it might help.
